# Flutter BLoC – Chapter 1 🧩

> **Goal:** Understand the BLoC pattern in Flutter, just the concepts you'll keep in your back‑pocket while building apps.

---

## 1. The Data Flow

* **UI → Event → BLoC**: User interaction turns into an **Event** sent to the BLoC.
* **BLoC → State → UI**: After processing, the BLoC emits a **State**; the UI rebuilds.

---

## 2. Key Vocabulary
| Term | What it is | One‑liner |
|------|------------|-----------|
| **BLoC** | *Business Logic Component* | A class that converts **Events** ➡️ **States**. Keeps UI & logic separate. |
| **Event** | Plain Dart class | *"Something happened"* (button tap, API request, timer) |
| **State** | Plain Dart class | *"Current snapshot"* of the UI (loading, data ready, error) |
| **Emit**  | BLoC method | Push a **new State** downstream. |

> **Remember:** Events **go in**, States **come out**.

---

## 3. Providing the BLoC
* **`BlocProvider`** sits high in the widget tree 🏔️ and creates/injects your BLoC instance so that any descendant can access it.
* Scope = from the provider downwards.  Nest providers if you need multiple BLoCs.

---

## 4. Reacting in the UI
| Widget | Purpose | Rebuilds UI? | Side‑effects? |
|---------|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **`BlocBuilder`** | Build widgets whenever a new **State** is emitted. | ✅ | ❌ |
| **`BlocListener`** | Listen for **States** to trigger actions (SnackBar, navigation, logs). | ❌ | ✅ |
| **`BlocConsumer`** | Combo of Builder + Listener. | ✅ | ✅ |

Tip: Add `buildWhen` / `listenWhen` filters to skip unwanted updates.

---

## 5. Equality Checks
| Operator | Checks | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `is` | **Type Identity** | `if (state is LoadingState)` |
| `==` | **Value Equality** | `if (state.count == 0)` |

Implement `==` & `hashCode` in your State classes (or use `equatable`) to avoid needless rebuilds.

---

## 6. Best‑Practice Cheat Sheet
1. **One source of truth:** UI never stores data it can get from the State.
2. **Pure BLoC:** No `BuildContext`, no Widgets inside BLoC files.
3. **Immutable States:** Create a new instance instead of mutating the old one.
4. **Small, focused Events:** Prefer many simple events over one catch‑all.
5. **Avoid duplicate emits:** Only emit when something actually changed.

---

## 7. Mental Model 🧠
> *Event* = **command**  •  *State* = **fact**

If you can explain what your feature does with just a handful of Events and States, you're on the right track.

---

## 8. Code Example (Internet Connectivity Monitoring)

### Core Implementation
```dart
// BLoC initialization
BlocProvider(
  create: (_) => InternetBloc(),
  child: const MyApp(),
)

// State management
BlocConsumer<InternetBloc, InternetState>(
  builder: (context, state) {
    if (state is InternetConnectedState) return Text('Connected');
    if (state is InternetLossState) return Text('No Internet');
    return CircularProgressIndicator();
  },
  listener: (context, state) {
    if (state is InternetConnectedState) {
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text("Connected!"), backgroundColor: Colors.green),
      );
    } else if (state is InternetLossState) {
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(content: Text("No Internet"), backgroundColor: Colors.red),
      );
    }
  },
)
```
